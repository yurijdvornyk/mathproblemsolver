{"name":"MathProblemSolver","tagline":"Open source solution for solving mathematical problems with user-friendly interface","body":"## Open source, easy to use solution for working with mathematical problems\r\n\r\nMathProblemSolver is the desktop application designed to simplify the process of creating and calculating different mathematical problems. It provides the user with friendly interface and simple API that allows to concentrate on mathematical aspects of the project.\r\n\r\n## MathProblemSolver business process consists of 6 major steps:\r\n\r\n1. **Download MathProblemSolver application and ProblemLibrary.** ![](https://github.com/yurijdvornyk/mathproblemsolver/blob/master/other/images/1_download.png)\r\n\r\n2. **Create your problem.** ![](https://github.com/yurijdvornyk/mathproblemsolver/blob/master/other/images/2_code.png) Extend `Problem` class or `IProblem` interface, override the methods, implement problem solving and build the project.\r\n\r\n3. **Load problem in MathProblemSolver.** ![](https://github.com/yurijdvornyk/mathproblemsolver/blob/master/other/images/3_load_to_app.png) Open \"Problem Repository\" and add your problem. If it has some external dependencies, add them in \"External Libraries Repository\".\r\n\r\n4. **Set input data.** ![](https://github.com/yurijdvornyk/mathproblemsolver/blob/master/other/images/4_set_data.png) Select your problem in Problem Data menu, fill all parameter values that your problem need to be solved.\r\n\r\n5. **Solve problem.** ![](https://github.com/yurijdvornyk/mathproblemsolver/blob/master/other/images/5_solve.png) Click on the \"Solve\" button to start calculating the problem result.\r\n\r\n6. **Get results.** ![](https://github.com/yurijdvornyk/mathproblemsolver/blob/master/other/images/6_results.png) After the problem is solved, check its results and save them to popular file formats or just print them.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
